# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the [Banking Management System](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**: Submit a new issue to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/issues) with a clear title and description. Include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

2. **Confidentiality**: If the vulnerability is sensitive in nature, please email us directly at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) instead of posting it publicly in the issue tracker.

3. **Provide Reproduction Steps**: Include clear and concise steps to reproduce the vulnerability. If possible, provide a code snippet, repository link, or any additional resources that can assist in understanding and validating the vulnerability.

4. **Avoid Data Destruction**: Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond the minimal amount needed to demonstrate the security issue. Avoid any actions that could result in the destruction, disclosure, or alteration of data or personal information.

## Response and Disclosure

Once a vulnerability report is received, we will review and acknowledge it as soon as possible. We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and keeping our users informed.

1. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate the reported vulnerability to assess its impact and validity. We may reach out for additional information or clarification during this process.

2. **Fix and Remediation**: Once we have verified the vulnerability, we will work on developing a fix. This process may involve code changes, configuration updates, or other necessary actions.

3. **Security Patch Release**: We will release a security patch or update to address the vulnerability. Depending on the severity and complexity of the issue, the timeline for the release may vary. We will make every effort to release fixes in a timely manner.

4. **Public Disclosure**: Once the security patch is released, we will disclose the vulnerability in the issue tracker or notify you via email if the vulnerability was reported privately. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the disclosure process.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the [Banking Management System](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository) repository and its associated code, configurations, and resources.

Please note that this security policy does not cover vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies or external components. We encourage you to report those vulnerabilities directly to the maintainers of the respective projects.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices by giving us reasonable time to address the reported vulnerability before making any public disclosures. We greatly appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the security of this project.
